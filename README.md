# Traffic Flow Analysis System

A comprehensive computer vision system for counting vehicles in multiple traffic lanes using object detection and tracking.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 for accurate vehicle detection
- **Object Tracking**: Implements IoU-based tracking to avoid double counting
- **Lane Assignment**: Automatically assigns vehicles to predefined lanes
- **Real-time Overlay**: Shows live counts and vehicle tracking on video
- **CSV Export**: Detailed vehicle data with timestamps and lane information
- **YouTube Support**: Can process videos directly from YouTube URLs

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
\`\`\`

2. The system will automatically download YOLOv8 weights on first run.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Process the default traffic video from YouTube:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/traffic_analyzer.py
\`\`\`

### Custom Video

Process your own video file:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/traffic_analyzer.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
\`\`\`

### YouTube Video

Process any YouTube traffic video:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/traffic_analyzer.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
\`\`\`

### Custom Output Directory

Specify output location:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/traffic_analyzer.py --output my_results/
\`\`\`

## Demo

Run the demo script to see the system in action:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/demo_runner.py
\`\`\`

## Lane Calibration

For better accuracy with specific camera angles, use the interactive lane calibrator:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/lane_calibrator.py path/to/video.mp4
\`\`\`

This tool allows you to manually define lane boundaries by clicking on the video frame.

## Output Files

The system generates:

1. **processed_video.mp4**: Video with overlay showing:
   - Lane boundaries (colored lines)
   - Vehicle bounding boxes with IDs
   - Real-time lane counts
   - Vehicle types and tracking

2. **vehicle_counts.csv**: Detailed data including:
   - Vehicle ID
   - Lane number
   - First/last frame seen
   - Timestamps
   - Vehicle type

## System Architecture

### 1. Vehicle Detection
- Uses YOLOv8 pre-trained on COCO dataset
- Detects cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks
- Confidence threshold filtering

### 2. Object Tracking
- IoU-based tracking algorithm
- Assigns unique IDs to vehicles
- Handles temporary occlusions

### 3. Lane Assignment
- Point-in-polygon testing for lane membership
- Uses vehicle centroid for assignment
- Prevents double counting across lanes

### 4. Counting Logic
- Tracks counted vehicles per lane
- Only counts each vehicle once per lane
- Handles lane changes appropriately

## Performance

- **Speed**: ~15-30 FPS on modern hardware
- **Accuracy**: >90% detection rate in good conditions
- **Memory**: ~2GB RAM for 1080p video processing

## Limitations

- Performance depends on video quality and lighting
- May struggle with heavy occlusion
- Lane definitions assume relatively straight lanes
- Requires manual calibration for complex camera angles

## Extensions

The system can be extended to:
- Count vehicles by type separately
- Measure vehicle speeds
- Detect traffic violations
- Process live camera feeds
- Support more complex lane geometries

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **CUDA/GPU errors**: The system works on CPU by default
2. **YouTube download fails**: Check internet connection and video availability
3. **Poor detection**: Adjust confidence thresholds or use lane calibrator
4. **Memory issues**: Process shorter video segments or reduce resolution
